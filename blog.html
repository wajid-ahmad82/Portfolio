                <p>It is time to customise your linkedin unique public profile URL.</p>
                <p>We all know how important, nowadays, LinkedIn is. It is the plateform primarily used for professional networking and career development, and allows job seekers to post their CVs and employers to post jobs.

                    On linkedin, how you have managed your profile is most important, as it tells recruiters about you. So it is important to make your profile well proportioned. In addition to profile management, it is necessary to customise your default public profile URL. Make your unique profile URL short, precise and beautiful_like instagram username. The default link provided by linkedin looks weird as it contains random letters and numbers, so it is good to change it. 
                    
                    In mobile app, to customise your public profile URL, first tab on "profile", situated at top left corner on home window. Then scroll down and you will see contact fold, on the right of the contact fold,  tab on a edit(pencil) option. A new window will appear, tab on the first link, another window will open. Now edit your public profile URL.
                    <br>
                    Note: Use your full name, if it is taken try to use it in different combinations.</p>
